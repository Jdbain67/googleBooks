# Google Book Search

This app allows users to search for any book and save their favorite ones, and eventually delete them if they so choose too.  
To accomplishe this, this app uses axios to call on the Google Books api and deliver the content the user is searching for, MongoDb as the nonrelational database used to store the user's favorite books and React to create the beautifully functional front-end. To enable the communication between our front-end and our back-end database, we use Express as our server and Mongoose to create our database Schema.
